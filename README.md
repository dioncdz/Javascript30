# <strong>This is JavaScript30</strong>

After finishing my Javascript course in Udemy(Jonas Schmedtmann), I looked for a project-based platform where I can focus on the application of what I have learned and stumbled upon Wes Bos' online course. 

I also started a #100DaysOfCode challenge so I can consistently showcase and use what I have learned studying web development.
